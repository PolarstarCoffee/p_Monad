~;~;#Kai;What the?! These people are crazy!;~;~
~;~;#Kai;I wandered into some freaky cult! They wanted me to do this ritual but they left out the part where they'd tear out my eyes!;~;~
~;~;#Kai;I was wondering how they saw differently. I thought it was some positive affirmation type of thing. I thought they just practiced meditation, hell even yoga! ;~;~
~;~;#Kai;Guess not. Just rip your eyes out! They want to abandon this world and let the darkness swallow everything or something. Let this world die and bring in the next one, huh? What a bunch of morons.;~;~
~;~;#Kai;Not sure how long I can hide here. May only be a matter of time before they come. At least they can't see me.;~;~
