~;~;#FatherGraham;My children, this world weighs heavy on us all, yet we endure.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;Our church was razed in the chaos, burned to rubble. I myself have been scorched by the flames. When everything was destroyed we could have given up, and yet we endure.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;We all have our scars. I know all to well about the constant reminders of our past. This world is overwhelming but the Lord will guide you if you open your heart.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;Through our Lord our suffering is eased. It is no easy task to open our hearts, I understand this struggle first hand, but with hope and faith we can overcome. We must overcome.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;Do not forget that trusting in the Lord means securing your peace in the next life. Our work in this life paves the way to heaven, where we may finally rest in everlasting paradise.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;I pray to our Lord that he may release some of the burdens that weigh heavy on your shoulders.;;
