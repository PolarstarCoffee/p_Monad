~;~;#Amelia;Oh, hello? Is someone there?;~;~
~;~;#Amelia;I am sorry, but, I cannot see. My name is Amelia. ;~;~
~;~;#Amelia;I used to love to paint but I lost my sight when the eye came. I still try to paint, though. No matter how difficult it can be.;~;~
~;~;#Amelia;You probably think I am silly for trying. Perhaps I am. I used to worry if my art was ever beautiful. Now that I am blind, I just wish I could see my works once more.;~;~
~;~;#Amelia;I do not paint for an audience. I paint so that I can feel good. If I feel good painting something, then it is beautiful no matter what others may say.;~;~
