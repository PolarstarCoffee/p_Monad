~;~;#Kai;These people are crazy!;~;~
~;~;#Kai;I wandered into a damn cult! They wanted me to do a ritual but they left out the part where the ritual requires them to take out my eyes!;~;~
~;~;#Kai;They seemed so enlightened. I was wondering how they saw differently. What was I thinking? I thought they just practiced meditation, hell even yoga! ;~;~
~;~;#Kai;Guess I know the truth now. They want to abandon this world. This cult wants the darkness to take over. Let this world die and bring in the next one, huh? What a bunch of morons. How they gonna see their new world? Ridiculous!;~;~
~;~;#Kai;Not sure how long I can hide here. May only be a matter of time before they come.;~;~
