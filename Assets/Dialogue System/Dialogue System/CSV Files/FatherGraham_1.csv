~;~;#FatherGraham;Hello there, strange…shadow man. If you mean us no harm, please do stay and enjoy what company we can offer.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;I understand the troubles we all currently face. When the church was razed and my face set asunder, I decided to relocate here in order to tend the flock.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;These days, hope runs short. I see it in every sober glance. Hear it in every wail. Am I a fool for clinging on? I don’t think so. What else can we use to fight evil, if not hope?;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;These bandages are my reminder. Reminder of my frailty, of my weakness. But, even despite my shortcomings, God has clothed me and continues to protect me. Through him all my suffering can be eased, and through me, I can only hope to ease yours.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;Have no fear of that thing in the sky. This time of suffering sharpens you. If you know what is worth holding on to… by God don’t let it go. Hold on to that hope to the end.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;What many don’t understand is that God is beyond us, but he is not apart from us. I see him everywhere. In every sacrifice. In every kind word. God is all around us. Aways.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;There is another like me, another man of the cloth. If you find him… practice some patience? For me, at least. I imagine that his faith, his strength, is fading. I don’t blame him. Faith can be enough to strengthen some, but… We can’t all be so lucky.;~;~
~;~;#FatherGraham;The world is a chaotic place, but He shall come save his people. Godspeed, traveler. Your burden will be lifted, but not through God alone. Go forth and walk the path.;~;~
