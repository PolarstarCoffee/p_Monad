~;~;#FatherCampbell;I cannot do this anymore. Not without you.;~;~
~;~;#FatherCampbell;Dangling paradise in front of my face just to rip it way. God why? How could you do this to me? You have taken everything! First my child and now my wife. I have nothing left;~;~
~;~;#FatherCampbell;Why God? My God that I held so dear, what have I done to deserve this? Why punish your faithful servant like this? I have loved you with all my heart. So, why?;~;~
~;~;#FatherCampbell;Father Graham would tell me to endure and to stay strong in my faith. I have had enough of that fool. What does he know? What has he lost? His face? His pride and dignity? His suffering pales in comparison to my own!;~;~
~;~;#FatherCampbell;I would give anything for my family back! Anything. How can I endure if everything I love does not? Why should I be strong in my faith when I have gotten nothing but misery in return?;~;~
~;~;#FatherCampbell;My God is dead, killed by something far greater. Is there any other explanation for this curse? What is that eye doing up there? What is it waiting for? Just end it already!;~;~
~;~;#FatherCampbell; End it all god damnit! End it all! What else is there? Huh?  Tell me! What else could there be for me in this god damned world! You have taken everything from me! EVERYTHING!;~;~
~;~;#FatherCampbell;Please. Just end it. I just want to see my family.;;
